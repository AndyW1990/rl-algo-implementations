# rl-algo-implementations

This repository is a place to store some of the algorithms I implemented when learning RL in 2020/2021. They are all done in Python using various Atari games with the Gym library.

Heres a list of the algorithms:

**Value Based Methods:**
- n-step SARSA
- SARSA-lambda
- Q-Learning
- Double Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
- Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQN)

**Policy Based Methods:**
- REINFORCE
- Actor-Critic
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)
- Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO)

Where Neural Networks are required, there's a mix of Pytorch, Tensorflow and pure Numpy implementations.

It's a bit thrown together at the minute, so I will look to add more and improve presentation/commentary in due course.
